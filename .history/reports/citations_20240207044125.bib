While it focuses on self-tracking data, the techniques explained are also applicable to sensory data in general, making it useful for a wider audience.

Self-tracking has become part of the modern lifestyle, and the amount of data generated by these devices is so overwhelming that it is difficult to obtain useful insights from it.

While there are ample books that explain machine-learning techniques, self-tracking data comes with its own difficulties that require dedicated techniques such as learning over time and across users.},
