# Machine Learning-based Quantification of Personal Fitness

### Introduction (Still needs more work)
Over the last few years, monitoring technology have taken a leap and helped free the many physical constraints carry-on sensors like GPS-trackers, accelerometers, and gyroscope posed. This has paved way for academic research in the field of tracking and classifying data collected from numerous human activities through means of wearable smartwatches. The aim of this research project is to deeply explore the various possibilities of context aware application in the field of strength training. The objective is achieved through means of collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing raw data collected from wristband gyroscope and accelerometer obtained during workout sessions.

### Initial Setup

Run the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install all the necessary packages. 

### Necessary Files

* **Data:** Raw data could be accessed from `./data/raw/MetaMotion`
* **Data Cleaning:** Data Cleaning and preprocessing have been done. The file can be found `./notebooks/create_dataset.ipynb`.
* **Final Dataset:** Final data set can be found in `./data/interim`
* **Data Visualization:** Only one visualization was done because cleaning the data took so long. The file can be accessed from `./notebooks/visualization.ipynb`.
